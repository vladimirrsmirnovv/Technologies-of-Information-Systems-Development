This Technologies of Information Systems Development repository contains some php code we had to learn as an express course to be able to create the web application which appears to be an e-shop.
We went from PHP basics and Unified Modeling Language (UML) to MySQL, and then creating our own app. 
We modelled all the needed processes for the app first, and then created a simple, but working website for selling products of any kind, but food in particular.
